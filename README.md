# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This is a landing page for Peddle Technologies built with react. 

## DESIGN PARADIGM
- Atomic designed principles were applied in the architecture. The components were built from the ground up. I started with the elements (the smallest part of the component) which can be found in the element folder. Then the molecules (one or two element put together), in the Molecule folder. Lastly, the Organism (composed of the compounds) are in the Compounds folder. The method to call the api for task two is in the services folder. This architeture and Folder structuring is for the separation of logic and easy code maintenance and readability.
